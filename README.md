## About the Video Course
The best way to learn any programming technology is to pick some well-defined problems and solve them using tools available in that technology. This course is about doing just that. Learn functional programming in Scala by exploring implementations of various algorithms and data structures. 
In this course, we explore several Scala features while implementing many searching and sorting algorithms and data structures. These include bubble and merge sort, KMP string searching, hash tables and balanced binary trees, and a detailed implementation of the closest pair algorithm.
